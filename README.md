Description about ROS


Q. What is ROS, and its merits and the limitations for robotics?
Ans. Robot Operating System is robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

    *MERITS*
    > ROS is an open source project with a permissive license.
    > ROS has great simulation tools
    > The same base code and knowledge can be applied to many different kinds of robots : robotic arms, drones, mobile bases, â€¦ 
    > Peer-to-peer communication
    > Thin
    > Multi Language
    *LIMITATIONS*
    > Maximum Size of a Message
    > Powerful hardware Required
