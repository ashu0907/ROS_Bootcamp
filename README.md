Description about ROS


Q. What is ROS, and its merits and the limitations for robotics?

Ans. Robot Operating System is robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.


    *MERITS*
    > ROS is an open source project with a permissive license.
    > ROS has great simulation tools
    > The same base code and knowledge can be applied to many different kinds of robots : robotic arms, drones, mobile bases, â€¦ 
    > Peer-to-peer communication
    > Thin
    > Multi Language
    *LIMITATIONS*
    > Maximum Size of a Message
    > Powerful hardware Required
    
    
Q. Explain the following :
  
  A. Workspace - a temporary digital storage area that contains related data and software files
  
  B. ROS Package - A ROS package is simply a directory descended from ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (see ROS Environment Variables) that has a package.
  
  C. Nodes -  Nodes are combined into a graph and communicate with each other using ROS topics, services, actions, etc
  
  D. Topics - Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages.
  
  E. Messages - A message is a simple data structure, comprising typed fields
  
  F. Services - Services are defined using srv files, which are compiled into source code by a ROS client library.
